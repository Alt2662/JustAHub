I initially started this project as a simple calculator, using basic math and an ability to use random numbers. Then, I added RPS and the balance system. Then I decided to add a main hub, a few mor games, a job, and an advanced calculator.
I'll probably update it very soon.
update 1, added some factorials
update 2, added the python turtle demo
